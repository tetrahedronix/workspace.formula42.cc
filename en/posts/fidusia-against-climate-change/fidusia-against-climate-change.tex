\title{Confidense Against Climate Change}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

In the anthill, the era of technological innovation had begun, and after months
of intense research, the programming ants gathered at sunset in the hall of a
large technological center built in the heart of the forest, where they
discussed animatedly.

``We are all limited by our insect capacities," said one. "Imagine how beautiful
life would be if we had advanced artificial intelligence to support us in the
development of our projects!"

``Yes," said another, ``and we could use it to optimize processes and prevent
errors."

``It could also suggest new ideas and keep security systems under control,"
added the wise Vecina, the eldest ant.

Then spoke Confidense, the expert in information theory, who with great commitment
and discipline spent her days collecting data and analyzing algorithms in her
small peripheral cell.

``Today I met a cicada named Melody. She was walking happily through the woods,
singing songs and telling stories, and she said to me: \emph{`Dear ant, why do
you perform all these calculations on artificial intelligence? It's a chimera,
just a flood could wash us all away. Come and enjoy the sun and music
with me while the weather is fine!'}"

``What did you reply?" asked the most curious ant of the colony.

``That from the analysis of meteorological data from the last months it seems
that a long period of drought and heat is coming. It's important that the
animal kingdom prepares to face it. But she seemed disinterested in my warning
and fluttered away high towards the Sun."

Hearing these words, the other ants hastened to gather resources to prepare
for the imminent threat with new zeal. Meanwhile, Confidense resumed her activity
as an analyst, determined to optimize the colony's performance and develop
advanced artificial intelligence because the fate of the anthill depended on
her ability to find the focal point among the mass of data at her disposal.
Nothing more was heard of poor Melody.
